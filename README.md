**Shared Libraries**

In Jenkins, a shared library is a way to store commonly used code(reusable code), such as scripts or functions, that can be used by different Jenkins pipelines.
Instead of writing the same code again and again in multiple pipelines, you can create a shared library and use it in all the pipelines that need it. This can make your code more organized and easier to maintain.
Think of it like a library of books, Instead of buying the same book over and over again, you can borrow it from the library whenever you need it.
will add remaining data later

**Advantages**

Standarization of Pipelines
Reduce duplication of code
Easy onboarding of new applications, projects or teams
One place to fix issues with the shared or common code
Code Maintainence
Reduce the risk of errors.
