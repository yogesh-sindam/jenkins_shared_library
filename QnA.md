Q: Can you explain the CICD process in your current project ? or Can you talk about any CICD process that you have implemented ?

A: In the current project we use the following tools orchestrated with Jenkins to achieve CICD.
   - Maven, Sonar, AppScan, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes
   
   Coming to the implementation, the entire process takes place in 8 steps
   ```
      1. Code Commit: Developers commit code changes to a Git repository hosted on GitHub.
    2. Jenkins Build: Jenkins is triggered to build the code using Maven. Maven builds the code and runs unit tests.
    3. Code Analysis: Sonar is used to perform static code analysis to identify any code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and bugs.
    4. Security Scan: AppScan is used to perform a security scan on the application to identify any security vulnerabilities.
    5. Deploy to Dev Environment: If the build and scans pass, Jenkins deploys the code to a development environment managed by Kubernetes.
    6. Continuous Deployment: ArgoCD is used to manage continuous deployment. ArgoCD watches the Git repository and automatically deploys new changes to the development environment as soon as they are committed.
    7. Promote to Production: When the code is ready for production, it is manually promoted using ArgoCD to the production environment.
    8. Monitoring: The application is monitored for performance and availability using Kubernetes tools and other monitoring tools.
